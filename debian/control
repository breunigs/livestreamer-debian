Description: CLI that pipes video streams to video players
 Livestreamer is a Command Line Interface that pipes video
 streams from various services into a video player, such
 as VLC. The main purpose of Livestreamer is to allow the
 user to avoid buggy and CPU heavy flash plugins but still
 be able to enjoy various streamed content.
 .
 Currently most of the big streaming services are supported
 (e.g. Dailymotion, Livestream, Justin.tv, Twitch, YouTube Live
 and UStream) and more specialized content providers can be
 added easily using Livestreamerâ€™s plugin system.
