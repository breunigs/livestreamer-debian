Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Livestreamer currently depends on these libraries/programs to function.

To run the setup script you need:

- `Python <http://python.org/>`_ (at least version 2.6) or `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
- `python-setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_


These will be installed automatically by the setup script if they are missing:

- `python-argparse <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse>`_ (only needed on Python version <2.7 and <3.2)
- `python-requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ (at least version 1.0)
