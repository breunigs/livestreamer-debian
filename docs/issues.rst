Streams are buffering/lagging
-----------------------------
By default most players do not cache the data they receieve from Livestreamer.
Caching can reduce the amount of buffering you run into because the player will 
have some breathing room between receving the data and playing it.

How to enable cache in the most common players
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
