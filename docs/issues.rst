Common issues
=============

.. _issues-player_caching:

Streams are buffering/lagging
-----------------------------

By default most players do not cache the input from stdin, here is a few options
you can pass to some common players:

- MPlayer/mplayer2/mpv: ``--cache <kbytes>`` (between 1024 and 8192 is recommended)
- VLC: ``--file-caching <milliseconds>`` (between 1000 and 10000 is recommended)
- MPC-HC: It does not seem possible to configure the cache right now unfortunately

Use the ``--player`` option in Livestreamer to pass these options to the player.


Player specific issues
----------------------

VLC fails to play with a error message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VLC version *2.0.1* and *2.0.2* contains a bug that prevents it from
reading data from standard input. This has been fixed in version *2.0.3*.

VLC hangs when buffering and no playback starts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some versions of 64-bit VLC seem to be unable to read the stream created by rtmpdump.
Using the 32-bit version of VLC is a workaround until this bug is fixed.

MPC-HC reports "File not found"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrading to version 1.7 or newer will solve this issue since reading data
from standard input is not supported in version 1.6.x of MPC-HC.
